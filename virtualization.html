     <h1>La Virtualisation</h1>
       <p>
        In computing,<b> virtualization </b> refers to the act of creating a virtual <i>(rather than actual)</i> version of something.<br>
        This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.

      <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
       <ol>
           <li>
             <h4>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</h4>
             <p>Every machine has an instruction set . This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.
             Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.
             </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <h4>Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</h4>
            <p>
            In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.
            </p>
             <ul>
              <li>In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware
               abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
              <li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating
              system between Virtual machines along with the hardware</li>
            </ul>
           </li>
      </ol>
